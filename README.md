A small project with very bad geometry, but fully working
____________________
1. In the window appears a matrix consisting of randomly arranged 16 first letters of the English alphabet
2. there are 9 buttons that rotate 9 submatrices of size 2 by 2 clockwise by one element
3. there are two textboxes in which you can enter indices of elements for permutation. The permutation function works only once during the duration of the program
4. When the letters are arranged in ascending order, you should press the check button to get the result of the program operation
